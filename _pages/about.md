About me 
======
- I am a Ph.D. candidate at School of Mathematics in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) since 2020, focusing on AI for medical image analysis and biomedical engineering, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoping Yang](https://math.nju.edu.cn/jzyg/apypl/20240321/i261837.html)

- Previously, I received a Bachelor’s Degree at School of Mathematics in [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Delu Zeng](https://scut-dacim.github.io/probre.html)

Recent News 
======
- November 3, 2025, I passed my Ph.D. defence! 
- September, 2025, our manuscript entitled "Deep Learning to Predict Extrapancreatic Perineural Invasion at CT images" has been accepted by *Annals of Medicine*. 

- February, 2025, our [new work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2025.103539) focused on pancreas and pancreatic cancer segmentation has been accepted by *Medical Image Analysis*. The highlights of this study can be summarized as follows:
  → A novel framework is proposed for pancreas and pancreatic cancer segmentation.
  → An Anatomy-aware Masked AutoEncoder is introduced for self-supervised pretraining.
  → A Causality-driven Graph Reasoning Module is developed for lesion core detection.
  → A Diffusion-based Discrepancy Calibration Module is designed for boundary refinement.
  → We achieve better segmentation performance for pancreatic cancer compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
