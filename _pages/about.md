About me 
======
- I am a Ph.D. candidate at School of Mathematics in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) since 2020, focusing on AI for medical image analysis and biomedical engineering, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoping Yang](https://math.nju.edu.cn/jzyg/apypl/20240321/i261837.html)

- Previously, I received a Bachelor’s Degree at School of Mathematics in [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Delu Zeng](https://scut-dacim.github.io/probre.html)

- You can find my CV here: [Liwen Zou's CV](https://github.com/ZouLiwen-1999/ZouLiwen-1999.github.io/blob/master/files/LiwenZou-CV.pdf)


Recent News 
======
- November 3, 2025, I passed my Ph.D. defence!

- October, 2025, [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/ae176e) entitled "Medical Image Segmentation Started from a Single Point Annotation: A Novel Variational Mode" has been accepted by <b>*Physica Scripta*</b>. 

- February, 2025, our [new work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2025.103539) focused on pancreas and pancreatic cancer segmentation has been accepted by <b>*Medical Image Analysis*</b>. The highlights of this study can be summarized as follows:
  - A novel framework is proposed for pancreas and pancreatic cancer segmentation.
  - An Anatomy-aware Masked AutoEncoder is introduced for self-supervised pretraining.
  - A Causality-driven Graph Reasoning Module is developed for lesion core detection.
  - A Diffusion-based Discrepancy Calibration Module is designed for boundary refinement.
  - We achieve better segmentation performance for pancreatic cancer compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- February, 2024, [our work](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41523-024-00628-4) entitled "Deep learning radiomics based prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer" has been accepted by <b>*NPJ Breast Cancer*</b>.
 
- February, 2024, our [new work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2024.102825) focused on peripancreatic vessel segmentation and labeling has been accepted by <b>*Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*</b>. The highlights of this study can be summarized as follows:
  - A novel framework is introduced for peripancreatic vessel segmentation and labeling.
  - An iterative trunk growth module is designed for vessel segmentation improvement.
  - A weakly supervised labeling mechanism is proposed for vessel branch identification.
  - A Diffusion-based Discrepancy Calibration Module is designed for boundary refinement.
  - We achieve better segmentation performance for peripancreatic vessel compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
  - We achieve competitive labeling performance for peripancreatic vessel compared to the fully supervised method.
 
- December, 2023, [our manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2023.3340686) entitled "A Weakly Supervised Segmentation Network Embedding Cross-scale Attention Guidance and Noise-sensitive Constraint for Detecting Tertiary Lymphoid Structures of Pancreatic Tumors" has been accepted by <b>*IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*</b>.
 
- August, 2023, our [new work](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/acf110) focused on dilated pancreatic duct segmentation in CT images has been accepted by <b>*Physics in Medicine and Biology*</b>. The highlights of this study can be summarized as follows:
  - We propose a novel cascaded segmentation framework driven by terminal guidance mechanism for the dilated pancreatic duct segmentation.
  - A terminal anatomy-aware module is designed to take the local intensity, feature cues of the targets and global anatomy information into account to improve the terminal segmentation performance.
  - A terminal distraction attention module is introduced to explicitly learn the distribution of the distraction tissues for reducing the false positive and false negative predictions.
  - We propose a new metric called tDice to measure the terminal segmentation accuracy for targets with tubular structures and two other metrics for segmentation error evaluation.
  - We achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance for dilated pancreatic duct segmentation compared to the existing works.

- May, 2022, [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.054202) entitled "Measuring the rogue wave pattern triggered from Gaussian perturbations by deep learning" has been accepted by <b>*Physical Review E*</b>.
